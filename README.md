## My GitHub Portfolio:

**My GitHub page showcases a number of data science projects I have worked on. I regularly add to this portfolio with new programming projects that are of interest to me.**

Here are a couple of examples of some of the projects i have worked on:

#### 1. Fake News Classifier 

The project sought to build a machine learning classification algorithm that could effectively categorise news articles as fake or real.

- Using Natural Language Processing techniques I classified 150,000 news articles. The algorithms used were Support-Vector Machine (SVM) Multinomial Naive-Bayes (MNB) and XGBoost, of which SVM was the most accurate.

The project is here: [Fake News Classifier](https://github.com/JUA96/fake-news-classifier)

Software used: 

- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks

Key Package Dependencies:

- Tweepy
- NLTK
- Spacy
- Sklearn

#### 2. Geospatial Analysis of London's Borough's

The project set out to see if we could predict London's house prices by the amount of well rated locations and venues in each borough. 

- Using Clustering Analysis I succesfully predicted which price segment a borough would fit into based on the type of venues that were in it.

The project is here: [London Geospatial](https://github.com/JUA96/Capstone-Project-Geospatial-Analysis)

Software used: 

- Python, IBM Watson Cloud

Key Package Dependencies:

- Sklearn
- Geopandas
- bs4
- json requests
- folium
- geopy

**Other Projects**

Some of my other projects have included:

- Social Media Analysis of the 2019 Democrat Presidential Primaries, using R.
- Analysis of the impact of Chinese Financial flows on state level governance in Africa, using R.
