# Hello and Welcome to my GitHub Portfolio!

**Master of Science Graduate (political science, economics), Data Analyst, and aspiring Data Scientist who is interested in innovative developments at the intersection of Data Science and Public Policy. In particular, I am fascinated by the positive impacts that state of the art machine learning models can have on society, governance and policymaking.**

I am a big fan of statistical modelling in R, but also have significant machine learning and data science experience with Python. Over the next few years I would like to build a substantial portfolio of R and Python projects, leveraging the various advantages of each language to build interesting and useful predictive models.

One of the areas I would like to focus on is using Natural Language Processing methods to extract insights from Social Media (Twitter, Facebook etc...) With the amount of data produced on social media there is an enormous need to analyse and establish trends/patterns in the mined datasets. The use cases could be in fields of counter terrorism, state security, combatting fake news, political strategy and marketing insights.

## My GitHub Portfolio:

**My GitHub page showcases a number of data science projects I have worked on. I regularly add to this portfolio with new programming projects that are of interest to me.**

Here are a couple of examples of some of the projects i have worked on:

#### 1. Fake News Classifier 

The project sought to build a machine learning classification algorithm that could effectively categorise news articles as fake or real.

- Using Natural Language Processing techniques I classified 150,000 news articles. The algorithms used were Support-Vector Machine (SVM) Multinomial Naive-Bayes (MNB) and XGBoost, of which SVM was the most accurate.

The project is here: [Fake News Classifier](https://github.com/JUA96/fake-news-classifier)

Software used: 

- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks

Key Package Dependencies:

- Tweepy
- NLTK
- Spacy
- Sklearn

#### 2. Geospatial Analysis of London Borough's

The project set out to see if we could predict London's house prices by the amount of well rated locations and venues in each borough. 

- Deploying Clustering Analysis techniques I succesfully predicted which **price segment** a borough would fit into based on the type of venues that were in it.

The project is here: [London Geospatial](https://github.com/JUA96/Capstone-Project-Geospatial-Analysis)

Software used: 

- Python, IBM Watson Cloud

Key Package Dependencies:

- Sklearn
- Geopandas
- bs4
- json requests
- folium
- geopy

#### 3. Predicting US Border Crossings 

The project aim was to see if it was possible to forecast US Border Crossings. Specifically, I wanted to predict which states and ports entrants would arrive through.

**Other Projects**

Some of my other projects have included:

- Social Media Analysis of the 2019 Democrat Presidential Primaries, using R.
- Analysis of the impact of Chinese Financial flows on state level governance in Africa, using R.
