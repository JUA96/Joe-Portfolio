# Joseph Arber 

üëã
Hi, I am Joe and Welcome to my GitHub Portfolio! I currently work as a Data Analyst for a DTC startup. I come from a political science background having completed my MSc in public policy analysis. Building on my training in computational social science methods including statistics and econometrics I have moved into the field of data science. The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase the range of different data driven projects and analyses I have undertaken over the past few years.  

## Interests üî≠ 
I am very interested in innovative developments at the intersection of Data Science and Public Policy making. In particular, I am fascinated by the positive impacts that open source colloboration and state of the data driven prediction can have on the governance and policymaking processes. I truly believe that there is massive room for innovation in how our institutions function. I often brings these thoughts and ideas together, for instance I contribute to a daily newsletter blog run by some fellow politically engaged peers, that can be found [here]https://www.polisanalysis.com/blog/polis-snapshots-what-is-polis-analysis-doing-to-address-the-problem-of-fake-news. 

üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª
Alongside my political science training I have also gained experience in the data science. I am a big fan of statistical modelling in R, but I also have produced machine learning models with Python. Over the next few months, maybe years... I would like to build a substantial portfolio of R and Python projects, leveraging the various advantages of each language to build interesting and useful models, tools and apps.

üó£
One of the areas I would like to focus on is using Natural Language Processing methods to extract insights from Social Media (Twitter, Facebook etc...) With the amount of data produced on social media there is an enormous need to analyse and establish trends/patterns in the mined datasets. The use cases could be in fields of counter extremism, combatting fake news, political and business strategy and generally being useful in helping to better understand public opinion across the digital world!

## üõ† My GitHub Portfolio:

**My GitHub page showcases a number of data science projects I have worked on. I regularly add to this portfolio with new programming projects that are of interest to me.**

Here are a couple of examples of some of the projects i have worked on:

#### 1. Fake News Classifier 

The project sought to build a machine learning classification algorithm that could effectively categorise news articles as fake or real.

- Using Natural Language Processing techniques I classified 150,000 news articles. The algorithms used were Support-Vector Machine (SVM) Multinomial Naive-Bayes (MNB) and XGBoost, of which SVM was the most accurate.

The project is here: [Fake News Classifier](https://github.com/JUA96/fake-news-classifier)

Software used: 

- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks

Key Package Dependencies:

- Tweepy
- NLTK
- Spacy
- Sklearn

#### 2. Geospatial Analysis of London Borough's

The project set out to see if we could predict London's house prices by the amount of well rated locations and venues in each borough. 

- Deploying Clustering Analysis techniques I succesfully predicted which **price segment** a borough would fit into based on the type of venues that were in it.

The project is here: [London Geospatial](https://github.com/JUA96/Capstone-Project-Geospatial-Analysis)

Software used: 

- Python, IBM Watson Cloud

Key Package Dependencies:

- Sklearn
- Geopandas
- bs4
- json requests
- folium
- geopy

#### 3. Predicting US Border Crossings 

The project goal was to see if it was possible to forecast US Border Crossings volumes. Specifically, I wanted to predict which states and ports, entrants would arrive through, as well as establish how likley it was the entrants would arrive on foot or by car. 

- Deploying various time-series forecasting models ARIMA and Random Walk, I succefully predicted the volume of entrants over the next 5 years. 

The project is here: [US Border Crossing Predictions](https://github.com/JUA96/VScode-ML-projects-python/blob/master/US-Border-Data.ipynb)

Software used: 

- Python, VS Code IDE

Key Package Dependencies:

- Sklearn
- scipy
- plotly
- calendar
- statsmodels
- json

#### 4. What influences European Voter Preferences?

This project was completed as a requirement for a quantitative methods module at graduate school. Using the European-Social Survey dataset I wanted to explore which factors determined how a respondent was likley to vote in respect to levels of EU integration. This was a fairly straightforward Logistic Regression problem, but I did arrive at some predicted probabilities for how likley a respondent would vote leave based on their age, sex, employment and trade union status. 

The project is here:[EU Voting Preferences](https://github.com/JUA96/logistic-regression-in-R/blob/master/EU-voting-preferences.Rmd)

Software used:

- R, R Markdown

**Other Projects**

Some of my other projects have included:

- Social Media Analysis of the 2019 Democrat Presidential Primaries, using R.
- Analysis of the impact of Chinese Financial flows on state level governance in Africa, using R.
- Predicting House prices using Bayesian methods
- Predicting whether a UK welfare claimant is likley to struggle with managing their debt
